I don't have time right now to do all of that but things are planned.

## Issues
TODO: Gedit syntax colors should match an industrial desaturated thematic, like vscode theme.

## Features
TODO: Glass theme for vscode.

TODO: Standard collor pallete with terminal color scheme.

## Maintainability
I can downsize the project and cleanup code to make it easier to mantain. Still it's important to keep compatibility with upstream as most bug fixes will be done there. 

TODO: Cleanup repo.

TODO: Rename to Arc Glass, move to GitLab and set an upstream repo.

## Distribution
TODO: Package for AUR.

TODO: Package vscode theme for extension store.

TODO: Package for popular distros like Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora.
