This is a fork of [jnsh/arc-theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme), that by itself is a fork of the original and not mantained [horst3180/arc-theme](ihttps://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme). Changes were made only in the Gnome Shell and GTK parts of the theme. Check also [horst3180/arc-icon-theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme).

Complementary addons to the dark version of the popular GNOME theme [arc-theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme). They provide themes for popular applications somewhat similar to the desktop theme. The goal is to provide a better and fully dark desktop experience.
